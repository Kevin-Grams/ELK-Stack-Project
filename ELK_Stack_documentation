## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.
Enter the playbook file:
	- Portions of the install-elk.yml playbook may be used to install only certain pieces of the playbook.

Description of the Topology:
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly REDUNDANT, in addition to restricting ACCESS to the network.
TODO: What aspect of security do load balancers protect? What is the advantage of a jump box?_
	- Load balancers ensure availability. A jump box limits the entry point flow of the network to a single node. 

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the file system and system metrics.
TODO: What does Filebeat watch for?_
	- Filebeat watches for log files as configured. 
TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_
	- Metricbeat records system and service metrics from a host device.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below:
| Name     | Function  | IP Address | Operating System    |
|----------|---------- |------------|---------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway   | 10.0.0.1   | Ubuntu Linux 18.04  |
| Web 1    | DVWA      | 10.0.0.5   | Ubuntu Linux 18.04  |
| Web 2    | DVWA      | 10.0.0.6   | Ubuntu Linux 18.04  |
| Highgarden|ELK Server| 10.0.1.4   | Ubuntu Linux 18.04  |



Access Policies:
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
TODO: Add whitelisted IP addresses_: 
	- The jump box accepts connections over the internet on port 22, but only for the IP 73.95.188.119 (my home IP).
	- The ELK server has a public IP and is accessible over the internet, but is severly whitelisted to only include connections from 73.95.188.119 to ports 80, 5601, 9200, 5044.

Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH via the Jump Box Provisioner.
TODO: Which machine did you allow to access your ELK VM? What was its IP address?
	- Jump Box IP = 10.0.0.4

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below:
| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses      |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Jump Box | No                  | 73.95.188.119, 10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.6, 10.0.1.4 | The Jump Box has a public IP, but is only allowed to be SSHed through the internet from my home IP.
| Web 1    | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 52.137.91.120   | Web 1 does not have a public IP, but any IP address may access the load balancer, and the load balancer forwards traffic to Web 1.
| Web 2    | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 52.137.91.120   | Web 2 does not have a public IP, but any IP address may access the load balancer, and the load balancer forwards traffic to Web 2.
| ELK-VM   | No                  | 10.0.0.4, 73.95.188.119   | ELK-VM does have a public IP, but it is severly whitelisted to only allow traffic to ports 80, 5601, 9200, 5044



Elk Configuration:
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?
	- The main advantage of Ansible's automation is that plays are lightweight and able to be saved and deployed at will, as needed. It allows for easy configuration across multiple devices.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
	- Install docker.io
	- Install python interpreter and docker python module
	- Increase virtual memory
	- Download and launch a docker elk container (Image: sebp/elk: 761)



Target Machines & Beats:
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring:
	- 10.0.0.5, 10.0.0.6 (Web 1 and 2 DVWA)

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed
	- Filebeat and Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._
	- Filebeat collects data about the file system and forwards to Kibana. Syslog beat collects syslogs, which send event messages to the log server.
	- Metricbeat collects system and service metrics. Metricbeat provides information on and analyzes system CPU usge and uptime. 
	
	
	
Using the Playbook:
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the ____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:
- Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?
	-  The playbook is called filebeat-configuration.yml. It is copied from /etc/ansible/files/filebeat-configuration.yml to /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
	- The hosts file determines which machines belong to your defined categories. The header of an Ansible playbook states which category of machines the playbook runs on.
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
	- To view the ELK server, navigate to the ELK VM's public IP and corresponding Kibana port. In this case, 104.214.75.168:5601
